# DesktopFuckerUpper
A C++ application designed to fuck up your desktop completely. Kind of work in progress.

Most of the stuff I got from reading the MEMZ payload code and some tutorials online(mostly syntax tutorials). Even if this is
begginer stuff I hope to add even more functionality which could be a great thing to prank your friends or something.

This program will be updated every once in a while. Please submit any issues, so I can have the experience of looking to fix them.
If you do submit an issue please add your system specs. :)
